# Codeforces Analysis App

A Streamlit web application that analyzes Codeforces competitive programming ratings and identifies "valleys" in a user's rating progression.

## Features

- **Rating Visualization**: View your rating progression over contests with interactive charts
- **Valley Detection**: Automatically identifies rating "valleys" - drops followed by recoveries
- **Comeback Analysis**: Calculates your comeback ratio to see how well you recover from rating drops
- **Dual Chart View**: Compare rating trends and rating-to-contest ratios side by side

## What are Rating Valleys?

A "valley" occurs when:
1. Your rating drops in one contest (oldRating > newRating)
2. Your rating rises in the next contest (oldRating < newRating)

The app highlights valleys in two colors:
- ðŸŸ© **Green**: Good valleys where you gained more than you lost (Rise > Fall)
- ðŸŸ¥ **Red**: Bad valleys where you lost more than you gained (Fall > Rise)
